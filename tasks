1. Read from .txt line by line  OK 
2. shuffle select the chunks (number of sequences to be showed) 
3. put the stop between the sequences
4. somehow discard eye-tracking data in the stop stage (put a fixation point in the screen and flags into the data file)
5. recording reaction times (could be in the same data file from eye-tracking?)
6. modify the processing file of eye-tracking data.
